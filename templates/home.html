<h1><u>Project Specifications</u></h1>
<p>
    Calculates pixel coordinate values for an image that is to be displayed on a two
    dimensional surface given the dimensions of the image and the corner points of 
    the image as it is to be displayed.
</p>
<p>
    For example, if an image is defined by a 3x3 grid of pixel values, and the
    (x, y) coordinates of the four corner points to display the image at are:
    (1, 1), (3, 1), (1, 3), and (3, 3) then the program should calculate and
    return the coordinates: (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2),
    (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3) which are the coordinates at which to place the 9
    pixels in the image such that they're evenly spaced within the corner points.
</p>
<h3><u>Input Specifications</u></h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Image Dimensions: </b>This will be a tuple defining the height and 
        width of the image in terms of pixel counts.<br> For example, an input for
        this parameter of (10, 12) means that the image has 10 rows and 12 columns.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
        <b>Corner Points: </b>This will be a list of two-element tuples defining
        the x and y coordinates of the image corner points of the displayed image.
        It consists of four (x, y) pairs.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3><u>Output Specifications</u></h3>
<p>
    Your program should calculate and return the x and y coordinates at which to
    plot each pixel in the input image such that the pixels are evenly spaced within
    the rectangle defined by the corner points.<br>
    The output should be of shape m x n x 2 where m is the number of rows in the input
    image and n is the number of columns in the input image.<br>
    The returned pixel coordinates are arranged in the order in which they would appear in
    the image (i.e. the first coordinate corresponds to the top-left pixel of the image).
